STEPS TAKEN
---
1. started up a miniconda env for the project, installed mesa, jupyter, and matplotlib
    a. remember to install pip before using pip to install other stuff
    
2. created a folder and python files within the folder
    a. used command `copy nul file.py` to create the blank py files 
    b. used command `del file.py` to delete the files I didn't need
3. changed all the file names to lowercase because they weren't working when the first letter was capitalized
